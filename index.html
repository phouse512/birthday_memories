					Ma dear. My, my, what a thoughtful and romantic (in his own way) manfriend you have. :) I am delighted to be a part of this birthday gift that will last forevaaaish. Where else to start, but the beginning? muhahahah... I met you (and Joy) in the summer of 2012 during those Detroit missions trainings (I met Phil for the first time the day you guys left for the trip! Do you remember that, Phil?), and immediately I knew you were among the gentlest of spirits one could ever know. What I did not know, was that, after some coffee dates, pie date, ice cream, fried chicken, car ride conversations, whatever hang outs, hiking/road trip, home-made dinners, and shmancy dinner dates later, we would be as toight as we are now. I am thankful for your giggles and smiles that poke me straight through mi heart; for your loud-ass voice when you'd least expect it and often in quiet places; for your honesty and pointed questions that really keeps a girl (me) straight; for your sharing the same passions for Jesus and compassion for others in need; for your prayers, often aloud (not loud) and in the moment; for your trusting me with oodles of your deepest darkest secrets hahahahah jk, for trusting me to keep you accountable; for giving me the gift of friendship and sisterhood that not anyone can have. I hope your 22nd year is: Pivotal. Grounding. Defining. Restoring. Embracing. &amp; filled with oodles and oodles of love! Happy Birthday Esther. May the Lord continue to bless you oodles and oodles more! I love you so very much! :) &#60;3

						Dear Esther,
						I hope this savvy little thing that Phil created for you stays around for a while, and that one day, many years from now, you'll be able to pull it up and be reminded of your days as a young woman in college, all the lives you touched, and the memories you made. I still remember the evening we walked up to Norris early in our freshman year where I ended up sharing my life story with you over a tomato and mozzarella crepe. I had never before experienced the depth of insight and care that you extended to me that night. It was the first time I had shared my testimony with a friend. I've always been so thankful to you for that, and I always will be.

						How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...
						Hehe but really, as I reflect on the past four years of our friendship/sisterhood/LOVE, I remember so many things that bring the widest of smiles to my face:<br />
						Walking together down Sheridan with Jane, singing the 'pizza song.'<br />
						Studying together on your bed in our beautiful CCI room.<br />
						Sharing earrings, and watching you apply your elaborate skincare routine (I know it's actually really simple, but it seemed so elaborate to me at the time).<br />
						Late night snacking, nail-painting, sharing, and ninth hours.<br />
						Quietly saying 'goodnight,' 'sleep tight,' and 'I love you' every night before falling asleep.<br /><br />

						Not to say that our more memorable moments together aren't important, but I think the little things and moments we've shared together are the memories that I'll cherish the most :3 You are such a treasure and a gem, Esther, and are so, so loved by the people around you. I'm writing you another card, so I shall save some lovin' for that space ;) Happy Birthday, beautiful.

						I'm eternally grateful for you and all the ways God has shown His love and grace through you. You really are a special friend to me.

						Happy 22nd birthday, love! I can't believe how time has flown and how much you have grown since that first dship we had at Lisa's. It's been a great blessing walking these years with you, and I am thankful for you always. I hope this new year will bring many new adventures, much growth, and new discoveries of our Father's love, grace, and plan. :)<br /><br />

						There are so many memories that I hold close to my heart, such as dship on the Lakefill with your mom's cooking, our shopping trips, learning together what it means to enjoy intimacy with our Father in heaven and reminding each other to live by grace, crying together in Norris and Plex basement and my apartment (and many other places, to be honest....), and you showing up with hydrangeas at my door unexpectedly (and texting me pictures of them all the time)! One memory that comes to mind though, even though it is quiet and subtle one, is when we prayed together last year in the observatory. I recall Rich and Kwang also happening to be there, and when we came together to share prayer requests and pray, I looked over at you, and sensed a hesitation about sharing--and knew immediately and exactly why. I think that's just one example of how like-minded and like-hearted we are, and that is a rare thing for me. :) You seem to be able to look into the deep places of my heart when I lacked words to express the things there. Thank you for being there to listen, for loving me, for receiving from me (because that means a lot too!) but most of all, for being yourself. Because you are loved not for what you do, but for who you are. :) <br />

						Esther, I am praying for you, sister. I pray that your love for God and others would only grow with each passing day, and that you would be a sweet fragrance for His name. I am so proud of you! <br />

						Have a very happy birthday!

						Dear Esther,<br /><br />

						Living in Korea, I’ve been actually wondering if I were living with an angel back in Evanston. In my high school years, I prayed that God would provide me with good friends and roommates, and He remembered and answered my prayers! When I saw you (with Sunah) looking for a room on the second floor at Parkes Hall, I never knew that I would be rooming with you. At that first manna, I felt peace. Indeed, my first impression of you was not mistaken. Your peaceful and smiley face is still impressed in my mind. You were also a peacemaker, introducing me to so many awesome people at Northwestern. Most of my close friends are the ones you introduced to me at Plex dining hall. Also, the first question that almost every upperclassman asked me at Focus-AAIV was “WOAH, you’re Esther’s roommate?” I felt so proud and honored. Esther, you are a blessing. You are making a quiet but deep impact in your community! Thank you again for your acts of kindness, your smiles, and your wonderful meals. <br /><br />

						Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.  -1 Timothy 6:11, 12

						HI ESTHER HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!<br /><br />

						I know it’s kind of out of the blue, but I’m really glad that I got to see you again for one more year before you left for the real world. Although you are my friend, you are also my role model, someone I strive to become like more. Thank you for setting an example to me in many ways (that you probably didn’t even intend to either). 
						So it’s weird huh?! ure a senior and I’m now an underclassmen  but to me, you’ll always be that cute little esther I remember from freshmen year   
						I really miss our small group. Although my current small group’s great as well, that freshmen SG was something special to me. We should have a reunion soon  <br />

						Let’s meet up plenty often before you leave, make great memories, then you could peace out I guess. <br /><br />

Your smile and sincerity is very contagious, and whenever I get the opportunity to catch up with you and talk about life, I am always very grateful to have met a sister so life-giving and encouraging. I would love to believe that it was truly in God’s plan to place you in my life. So as you gain one more year of age, I hope you can embrace the future with grace, boldness, and most importantly trust in His faithfulness. Also, continue to be the light that you are. We need to always pray to God that we can be salt that never loses its saltiness! Hope you have an awesome day filled with so much happiness and blessings from your friends and family.

						Happy Birthday Esther! I hope your senior year has been going well. I was thinking about the memories that we've had together, and the two that popped into my head both involved our trips to Starved Rock. Our group camping trip before sophomore year started was one of my best memories of college! Remember how we were twins in the group? haha and then we were supposed to trick freshman into thinking that we were cousins but that never worked out because I forgot about the whole thing... I think I got to know you better through camping and going to Starved Rock afterwards! I only realized this now while trying to look for pictures from the trip and realized that you're not in that many pictures... how clever of you to dart away from the camera :P But then we went to Starved Rock again with Phil, Tara, and Josey! That was such a fun trip too! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did haha, and I also hope that you'll have more adventures in the future! <br /><br />
						 
						I wish you the best and lots of open doors, growth, love, and fun as you age one more year! Have a wonderful birthday!

I hope you feel showered in love today and that this coming year - no matter what it holds, with all its surprises and mysteries and newness - is one full of blessings, growth and fulfillment.  Love you!<br /> <br />  

						P.S: When I have to think of memories of the two of us, the first one that pops into my head is me hiding from you (and your supposed boyfriend) at Marshalls (LOL). To think our friendship could have started on that day.

						Hi Hi  I see you everyday. But today is a special day because it is your BIRTHDAY!! Esther, I wanted to say that I am very grateful for your kindness and care as my roommate. I am very very glad that I found this Spirit-of-God-filled house and that I got to get closer to you! I honestly am so happy with my housing situation this quarter, thanks to you, Christina, and Yitian. Altho we had the fire incident a couple of days ago, I think we bonded much more through that experience. However, I am excited to get to know you even better! Let's have more talks in the midst of our busy lives. I want to hear more about your dreams and concerns and stories! And I hear that you are a good listener, too, according to Josh lol.<br />
						You might catch my grammar mistakes here and there, but bear with me, as I am a slow but continuous learner. You might find out more about my weirdness, too, as time goes by. Be prepared  I love that yummy foods just appear in our house; I love it!  I like cooking when I have time and I shall learn from you, Chef Lee. I am writing this right in front of you as you are working so hard (or maybe looking up recipes hard..?) as I am eating the chocolate zucchini bread hehehe. Hope your midterm went well (by the time you read this because you said you have a midterm on your bday) and hope you have/had a wonderful 22nd BIRTHDAY!

						Dear Esther (aka da bestest fg leader in da House heh heh heh)<br /><br />

						First off. HAPPY 22nd BIRTHDAY! I still remember discussing your 21st in Norris, and you sharing with me that hilarious freshman year experience surrounding going out and your indifference to alcohol. Then skipping forward in time and you wanting to order wine at Tapas. HAHA. Trying to make a delinquent out of me. Tsk. 
						Anywayz. Moving on to the real feelz.<br />

						How do I put into a brief letter how much you've impacted my Northwestern experience? I don't think I'll be able to fully appreciate or understand everything that you've invested in your first ever freshman family group. Because you being you, you never asked for acknowledgement of any kind. You took out time to bake goodies for us, shared parts of your life and your self you didn't have to, trekked all over everywhere to give us goodie bags when you definitely had more important things to do, and were always there despite our obnoxiousness and flakiness...all during what was probably the busiest time of your school career. 
						The time, energy, compassion and vulnerability that you shared and continue to share with us, with me, take on more and more meaning as my time at Northwestern increases and I realize...dang. It's so hard to be open with people when yes, we may be growing, but yes, many of us are at our most uncertain and judgmental. And dang, it's even harder to invest time and energy into people you hardly know.<br />

						Thank you Esther for our 1 on 1s, your constant willingness to make yourself uncomfortable for my sake and FOR DECIDING TO BE A FAMILY GROUP LEADER (even though who knew your fg would be so sassy)! I feel sorry for those popo freshies who weren't able to get "The Esther Lee Experience."<br />

						In the meantime, ENJOY THIS BIRTHDAY CAUSE YOU'RE FEELIN 22~<br /><br />

						I hope that Philip's treating you right because he is way way way way (did I mention way) lucky. I hope you celebrate your birfday in your version of AMAZING~ cause you da empress (I felt empress was fitting seeing as you gave birth to the queen (me), the princess (Eugin) and the slave (Philip)).

I pray that as you graduate, you look forward with your pretty smile and optimism and bless those around you with the love of God! :) Although I'm really sad that you'll be graduating, and a part of my brain refuses to believe you're really a senior, I will definitely cherish the remaining months! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ESTHER! Have a fantastic birthday :)

						I am tremendously blessed to be your friend and to grow with you while I was in college. You're like a real older sister to me and I really appreciate that. You are one of the few people that I really trust with a lot of my baggage. Thanks for being so present in my life! And enjoy a great 22nd birthday :)

						HAPPY BIRTHDAY ESTHER!!!<br />
						Esther, I am so glad that I have gotten to know you the past couple years! I feel that you are such a positive influence in so many people's lives, and I thank God so much that you are on this Earth, in Northwestern, in AAIV, and in Lakeview. I hope to get to know you more as we do womens group together for the rest of this quarter! Lets have a bonding time soon to not only think more about how to serve God through women's group but also to just get to know more about each other as sisters in Christ!!!!! :) 
						Love you and appreciate you and respect you very much!

						Hey Esther,<br /> I can't believe that a little more than a year ago I met you at your place for the freshmen joint south campus family group dinner. Since then I have had the honor to be a member of your family group and cherish your effort and thought you put into us. This might seem more like a thank you letter than a birthday letter but I just wanted to highlight why you've been such an important part of my walk here at Northwestern. As a family group leader myself, though not of freshmen, I can empathize with how you might have felt as you served and all the time you put into creating a community for the flaky sassy group we were. Thank you for inviting me to your place and cooking me meals and getting to know me, I know now how easy it is to get sucked up into your own Northwestern experience and not reach out to freshmen. Thank you for coming out to my orchestra concert fall quarter. I never had the support of friends like I did that day and although I didn't join you at koi afterwards to hear your love story ;) it meant a lot to see people from family group there! Thank you for all the baked goodies and goody bags during reading week. The personalized cards must have taken forever to write. Thank you for your perseverance to the end. Though people came and went you were always there, week to week, willing to share a meal with us. Thank you for inviting me to be a part of your community and creating special at shepard last year. I hope you have a wonderful 22nd birthday and a great senior year. Hope to catch up with you soon, even though it's already been more than a quarter.

						HIIIII ESTHER! HAPPY 22ND BIRTHDAY! 
						I hope you have a lovely day today celebrating this special occasion! I sort of know that you will have an amazing day today even from Phil's idea of creating a website for ya ehehhe. ITS SO CUTE klsjflekaflwkeaf ;D. Thank you so much for being such a crucial part of my Northwestern life, especially fall quarter of freshman year. I still remember meeting you at your apartment when you and Paul hosted a dinner party for AAIV in the beginning o the quarter, and honestly, if it weren't for you, I don't know if I would have known about family group and have been plugged into this amazing AAIV community. I think I'll have to thank you and God eternally for that! You are such a kind-hearted, caring, sweet soul and esther-you truly make others feel so comfortable and so loved when theyre around you. I really think God has given you this special talent of reaching out to others and making people feel accepted and loved and I'm so excited to see God use you in the future to do amazing things in this world. Thank you for always being there for me to talk about my relationship with God, my concerns/doubts about my faith/life/whatever and simply for caring. As you may or may not remember, fall quarter freshman year wasn't the easiest transition for me and it really meant a lot to me when you took me out for brunch on my birthday hehe. and I can't believe that was already a year and a half ago! It's been a crazy ride at Northwestern so far, but thank you for being such a blessing to me so far! Again, happy birthday! We should do more phil x2 + double-E things in the future hehe. maybe also baking sessions with the other family group girls? (i really miss your cupcakes and baked goods you used to bring to fam group). Love you Esther!

						Hi Esther, remember the time that I dragged you and Phil out to the lakefill to help me film a birthday video for my (not in a possessive kinda way obviously :P) Esther? Well, minus the lakefill and filming and all that fun stuff, I figured it's my turn to return the favor. Happy birthday! Hope senior year has been going well for you and that you are enjoying every single moment of it. Cherish it because the days sure do fly by.
